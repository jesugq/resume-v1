# My Curriculum Vitae
Hello, and welcome to the repository for my resume. Nothing out of the ordinary, but it makes updating it fun and close to github, where I save my projects.

In this repository I'll be following Udacity's **one commit per logical change** approach and hopefully not flood my commit history.
